This is very short script, which uploads Holocene Volcanoes (Holocene.xlsx) based on open-access data from **Global Volcanism Program of Smithsonian Institution** (National Museum of Natural History - https://volcano.si.edu/volcanolist_holocene.cfm)
into a simple folium map. It also includes population of countries based on data from 2005 (world.json). 

You can just download zip, extract the folder, run the code and the script will create "HoloceneVolcanic_Map" file. Click over an interesting volcano for the pop-up with elevation information and automatic google link. :)

This is v 1.0. Future updates planned according to the newer data available.
