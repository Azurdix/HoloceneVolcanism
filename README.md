This is very short script, which uploads Holocene Volcanoes (Holocene.xlsx) 
based on open-access data from Global Volcanism Program of Smithsonian Institution (National Museum of Natural History - https://volcano.si.edu/volcanolist_holocene.cfm)
into a simple folium map. It also includes population of countries based on data from 2005 (world.json).

This is v 1.0. Future updates planned according to the newer data available.
